# MVC Intro & JS Object Prototypes

## Date: 10/15/19 W8 D3 D34

### Summary

Everything in JavaScript is an object. We practiced setting methods on object prototypes and learned how every instance of that object will have access to those same methods. We learned the ES6 way of creating classes with constructors and methods included in the class function. Static methods were also introduced as methods that only belong to the class object itself and none of its children instances.

We were introduced to express which was a 'code-along' and can be found in the `expressapi` folder. Several npm modules were recommended to use on future projects such as helmet and compression.

The `OO-JS` folder contains solo work from exercises geared to get us practice writing objects.
